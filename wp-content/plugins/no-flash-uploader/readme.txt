Please Note: I *highly* suggest attempting to seek help in order to fix any problems with the flash uploader in the support forums before resorting to this plugin if the uploader simply does not work. 
I personally use the Flash uploader, and find it does a good job.

Please take a read of this support post in order to determine what may be causing the uploader to fail: http://wordpress.org/support/topic/164999
